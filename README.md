## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the Udacity Classroom.

## Development

The JS code version is ES6, The navbar is generated with javascript code based on the number of sections, I've added a scroll to top button, and I managed to highlight the navbar item when the user is viewing it's section.

Most of the changes happened in the `js/app.js` and `css/styles.css` .

## Done
